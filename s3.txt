S3: Simple Storage Service : AWS Version of GDrive..

--> Block Based Storage : Designed to run the OS		: EBS, Instance Store
--> Storage Over Network (SAN/NAS) 				: EFS, FSx
--> Object Based Storage : Designed to store flat files		: S3

S3:
--> We can store any file.
--> We cannot install / Run Operating SYstem / Application.

--> We store all data in Buckets. 
--> Bucket is a Directory/Folder, with Unique namespace across the globe.
--> Defaultly, 100 is a softlimit for bucket count. 

--> S3 Bucket Naming standards.. 
	--> Min 3 Char, Max 63 Char
	--> should not contains Uppercase letter
	--> Should not start with . end with . no adjesent ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
	--> Should not begin with xn--

--> S3 is a Global resource. (From Single console we can see all region resources).
--> WHile creating we need to choose the region, Actual data stores there.


Free Tier : 
5 GB Standard Storage
2000 PUT (Upload)
20,000 GET (Downloads)

--> In S3, No Pre-Provisioning required.
--> Pay-as-you-go.
--> We can store Unlimited Data in S3 platform.

--> In AWS, Based on access patterns, we can choose the approprite Storage class. 


Access Pattern : How freq data is accessed. 

		GDrive		AWS S3

100 gb		90 gb		

Freq		10 gb		Standard
InFreq		20 gb		Standard-IA / OneZone-IA
Archieve	50 gb		Glacier / Glacier Deep Archieve
Don't know	10 gb		Intelliget Tier


S3-Standard : Frequetly accessed data..  Data Spread across >=3 AZs
Availablility : 99.99%, Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

Standard-IA (infrequntly access) : In-Frequetly accessed data.. But available immediatley..  Data Spread across >=3 AZs
Availablility : 99.9%, Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

S3-OneZone IA : In-Frequetly accessed data.. But available immediatley..  Data Spread across 1 AZs
Availablility : 99.5% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

S3 Gacier : Archive data for shorter durations.. Data will not be available immedialtly..
We need to perform data retrival to get the data.. Retival takes Min-Hours..
Availablility : 99.99% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

S3 Glacier Deep Archieve : Archive data for longer durations.. Data will not be available immedialtly.. Retival Hours to Days..
We need to perform data retrival to get the data.. 
Availablility : 99.99% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

S3-Intelligent tier : If we have unknown access patterns.. 
Availablility : 99.9% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

RRS : Reduced Redundancy Storage : Non-Critical data / easily reprodusable data.. 
Availablility : 99.9% , Durability: 99.99%

If we don't have any . in bucket Names..
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname

If we have . in bucket name..
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/foldername/objectname

--> Public Access Settings : Block all Public Access

--> If we want to make any object public, First edit the "Public ACcess Settings" in bucket. then make object Public. 


Glacier Restoration:

Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.



Bucket Versioning : 
___________________

--> S3 keeps multiple copies of our files. 
--> Most recent upload will be available if we don't enable Versioning.
--> If we accidentally delete any object, We can get it back.
--> We can track all changes happening on the file.

Version: HIDE
--> If shows only latest version of the object.
--> If we delete the object, We will get the DELETE Marker.
--> If we want to get the object back, Delete the "Delete Marker".

Version: SHOW
--> It shows all the versions of the object.
--> If you delete any Obj Version, It deletes perminantly.

Multipart upload: FIle becomes as small chunks (parts) then all small parts upload to s3 then it combines.

Replication : DR
	--> CRR (Cross Region Replication) : Replica copy stores in Another region
	--> SRR (Same Region Replication) : Replica copy stores in another bucket in same 		region
--> Versioning must be enabled.

--> Before enabling Replication, Whetever data we have in SOurce, won;t replicate to destination.   (aws s3 sync Sourcebucket destination)



Static website hosting: 
--> S3 supports only static website hosting.
--> Domain Name Should be same as Bucket Name.
--> Index.html / Error.html

http Status Codes : 
2XX : OK / Success
3XX : Redirection error
4XX : Client Side Error	
5XX : Server Side Error


WinSCP / S3 Browser / Cyberduck / CLoudberry explorer..!!!
aws s3 cp s3://bucketnme c:/newfolder --recursive
