S3: Simple Storage Service : AWS Version of GDrive..

--> Block Based Storage : Designed to run the OS		: EBS, Instance Store
--> Storage Over Network (SAN/NAS) 				: EFS, FSx
--> Object Based Storage : Designed to store flat files		: S3

S3:
--> We can store any file.
--> We cannot install / Run Operating SYstem / Application.

--> We store all data in Buckets. 
--> Bucket is a Directory/Folder, with Unique namespace across the globe.
--> Defaultly, 100 is a softlimit for bucket count. 

--> S3 Bucket Naming standards.. 
	--> Min 3 Char, Max 63 Char
	--> should not contains Uppercase letter
	--> Should not start with . end with . no adjesent ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
	--> Should not begin with xn--


--> S3 is a Global resource. (From Single console we can see all region resources).
--> WHile creating we need to choose the region, Actual data stores there.


Free Tier : 
5 GB Standard Storage
2000 PUT (Upload)
20,000 GET (Downloads)

--> In S3, No Pre-Provisioning required.
--> Pay-as-you-go.
--> We can store Unlimited Data in S3 platform.

--> In AWS, Based on access patterns, we can choose the approprite Storage class. 


Access Pattern : How freq data is accessed. 

		GDrive		AWS S3

100 gb		90 gb		

Freq		10 gb		Standard
InFreq		20 gb		Standard-IA / OneZone-IA
Archieve	50 gb		Glacier / Glacier Deep Archieve
Don't know	10 gb		Intelliget Tier


S3-Standard : Frequetly accessed data..  Data Spread across >=3 AZs
Availablility : 99.99%, Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

Standard-IA (infrequntly access) : In-Frequetly accessed data.. But available immediatley..  Data Spread across >=3 AZs
Availablility : 99.9%, Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

S3-OneZone IA : In-Frequetly accessed data.. But available immediatley..  Data Spread across 1 AZs
Availablility : 99.5% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

S3 Gacier : Archive data for shorter durations.. Data will not be available immedialtly..
We need to perform data retrival to get the data.. Retival takes Min-Hours..
Availablility : 99.99% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

S3 Glacier Deep Archieve : Archive data for longer durations.. Data will not be available immedialtly.. Retival Hours to Days..
We need to perform data retrival to get the data.. 
Availablility : 99.99% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

S3-Intelligent tier : If we have unknown access patterns.. 
Availablility : 99.9% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

RRS : Reduced Redundancy Storage : Non-Critical data / easily reprodusable data.. 
Availablility : 99.9% , Durability: 99.99%

If we don't have any . in bucket Names..
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname

If we have . in bucket name..
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/foldername/objectname

--> Public Access Settings : Block all Public Access

--> If we want to make any object public, First edit the "Public ACcess Settings" in bucket. then make object Public. 


Glacier Restoration:

Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.



Bucket Versioning : 
___________________

--> S3 keeps multiple copies of our files. 
--> Most recent upload will be available if we don't enable Versioning.
--> If we accidentally delete any object, We can get it back.
--> We can track all changes happening on the file.

Version: HIDE
--> If shows only latest version of the object.
--> If we delete the object, We will get the DELETE Marker.
--> If we want to get the object back, Delete the "Delete Marker".

Version: SHOW
--> It shows all the versions of the object.
--> If you delete any Obj Version, It deletes perminantly.


LCR : Life Cycle Management RUle :
__________________________________

Using LCR : We can transit object from one storage class to another storage class.

Multipart upload: FIle becomes as small chunks (parts) then all small parts upload to s3 then it combines.

Replication : DR
	--> CRR (Cross Region Replication) : Replica copy stores in Another region
	--> SRR (Same Region Replication) : Replica copy stores in another bucket in same 		region
--> Versioning must be enabled.

--> Before enabling Replication, Whetever data we have in SOurce, won;t replicate to destination.   (aws s3 sync Sourcebucket destination)



Static website hosting: 
--> S3 supports only static website hosting.
--> Domain Name Should be same as Bucket Name.
--> Index.html / Error.html

http Status Codes : 
2XX : OK / Success
3XX : Redirection error
4XX : Client Side Error	
5XX : Server Side Error


WinSCP / S3 Browser / Cyberduck / CLoudberry explorer..!!!
aws s3 cp s3://bucketnme c:/newfolder --recursive

Requester pays : When enabled, the requester pays for requests and data transfer costs, and anonymous access to this bucket is disabled.

Cloudwatch : Monitoring Service in AWS. We will get the Metrics (Graphical format).

KMS : Key Management Service : 


In-Transit Encryption :  
	--> SSL/TLS

Service Side Encryption / At-Rest : After uploading data to s3.. 

--> SSE - S3 : S3 platform can encrypt and decrypt the data. However have valid access on s3, they can decrypt/view the data.

--> SSE - KMS : In KMS we need to generate the Key, and Whoever have the Key usage permissions, only they can view the data.   Key Material is Generated and managed by KMS.

--> SSE- kms C (Customer Provided) : IN KMS we need to upload the key material, and Whoever have the Key usage permissions, only they can voew the data.   Key Material is Provided by customer and managed by KMS. 

Client Side Encryption : 
--> If customer is not ready to send unencrypted data to s3. 
--> Customer is responsible for encry / decryp data. 
--> If customer is not ready to share/upload his key material to aws. 

User 1 : S3FullAccess : Key Usage permissions on KMS: 
User 2 : S3FullAccess : 

KMS Key Creation : 
--> Choose the mechanism : Symmetric / Asymetric
--> GIve alias name to the key
--> Who Can Administrate the Key.?
--> Who can use the Key..?

_____________

Object Lock : 

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.
