On-Demand ec2 Instances : Unpredictable workloads/usecases : Test your applicaiton with multiple configs.... 
Pricing : /hr .. /sec (Min of 60 Seconds..)


Reserved Instance (RI) : Predictable workloads.. Longterm runs in aws.. We need to choose the config.. 
Duration : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs.. 

	--> Standard RI : We cannot change the config.. 
	--> Convertable RI : We can change the config (upgrade).. 
	--> Scheduled RI : for repeated req/ persistant req.. (ex: Mon-Fri)

Pricing : 
	--> FullUpfront : Pay 100% while purchasing.. 
	--> Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50% now.. AWs reduces the Hourly price.. Pay for the 		reduced hourly price for actual usage in the month.. 
	--> No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis. 

--> In AWS Marketplace, we can sell our reserved instances.

Spot Instances : We need to bid our price against aws pricing.. If quoted price is equal / more than aws priceing, we will get the instance.
--> If our application have flexible start/stop duration. 
--> If our app doesn't required 24x7 up and running.. 
--> If you nwant to test High configs with low cost.. 

RUn : 1 Hr , 30 Minutes.. 
Pricing : If Price increased, AWS terminated our instance.. 1 Hr..

ec2: It supports only Server calss OS. 

Launch a Windows ec2 instance. 

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 	: OS (Deafult/GAMI / Marketplace/community) : Windows Server 2016

Step 2: Choose an Instance Type : 

General Purpose : Stable perormance : suitable for most of the workloads.. : t2, t3, a1, m4
COmpute optimized : More CPU usage : c4, c5
GPU Instances : More Graphic usage : p2, g4
Memory utilisation : More RAM/Memory usage : r3, r4, r5, x1, z1
Disk utilisation : d, i

c5.xlarge : 4vCPU, 8 RAM.. 
m5.xlarge : 4vCPU, 16 RAM..
t3.large : 2vCPU, 8 RAM.. 


Free TIER : t2.micro : 1vCPU, 1 RAM.. 

Step 3: Configure Instance Details

Shutdown behavior : Stop
Enable termination protection : Enabled

Step 4: Add Storage

Windows : 30 gb
Linux : 8 gb 

Step 5 : Add tags

Name: XXX
Platform :WIndpows / Linux
Cost Center : AAZAA

Step 6: Configure Security Group

Firewall at Instance level.
Port : 0-65536
WIndows : RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) : Port 3389 : 
Linux : SSH (Secure Shell) : Port 22 : 

http  : Port 80 : 
https : Port 443 : 
mssql : Port 1433
Mysql : Port 3306

Anywhere : Anyone can connect from any network.. : 0.0.0.0/0
Custom : We can give any network IP
MyIP : It picks currently connected network IP

Step 7 : Review and Create a Keypair.

Keypair: It provides Username, Password information. It works with Public/private key.. ENcryption happens here.


Option 1 : Start --> Remore desktop conenction --> open it.
Option 2 : Win+r --> mstsc 
Option 3 : choose instance --> connect --> RDP CLient --> Download --> Open 


Public IP : Unique across the globe.

Stop/start : We don't loss any data.
Terminate : Delete Permanantly.

Task 1 : Launch a Windows server 2016 instance, Login with initial password, change the password.  Try to use the system password and verify it works or not..????

Task 2 : Create another User in Server, Provide remote desktop permissions and local admin permissions. Try to connect as that newly created user.

	Output: 2 sessions should be active at a time.

ec2 : 

Tenancy : 
--> Shared Tenancy : Underlying physical resources shared with multiple customers. 
--> Dedicated tenancy : Underlying physical resources will not be shared with any other customers. Dedicatedly avaibale to one customer usage.  (NO FREE TIER)
	--> Dedicated Host : We can apply licenses at CPU cores / HW lavel.
	--> Dedicated Instance 

SG :
WIndows : WIndows_ManagementSG : 3389
Linux : Linux_ManagementSG : 22

ec2config service takes sometime to up and running in windows instances. 
Windows : iis

http:// --> 80
https:// --> 443


Security Groups:
--> CHanges to the SG takes effect immediatel.y. 
--> No need to reboot / start / stop the instance.
--> One SG we can associate with multiple instances.
--> One instance can be associated with Multiple SG also. 
--> We always need to takes care about the Inbound rules only, as SG are stateful. 

public doc root path : c:/inetpub/wwwroot/  --> place all the files.


Stop and STart instance will give us a new Public IP address. 
THis is not recommendced for Production env. 

Elastic IP : EIP : If we allocate EIP to our ec2 instance, it gives a fixed IP address. Stop/start won't change this EIP.  (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBLE)


Can we associate multiple IPs to our instance.? Yes..
ENI : Elastic Network Interface.. : 


Task: Launch an ec2 instance and install iis. Deliver for everyone.

VOlume : Storage 

root : OS : gp2/gp3.. io1/io2.. Standard.. 
IOPS : Input and Output Operations per Second.


general Purpose SSD : gp2/gp3 : most commonly used volume.. STable performance.. 
	Min: 1 GB, Max: 16 TB..   IOPS : 16,000.. 
	Small and medium sized Databases.. (mssql/oracle).. Dev/Test environment..
	Ratio : for 1 gb, we will get 3 IOPS only.. with min of 100.. 1 : 3 ratio.. 	
		

Provisioned IOPS SSD : io1 / io2 : Highest performance SSD.. 
	Min: 4 GB, Max: 16 TB..   IOPS : 64,000.. 
	I/O sensitive application.. i.e; NOSQL, Relational databases.. 
	Ratio : for 1 gb, we will get 50 IOPS, 1:50 ratio... 
	but we have an option to choose desired IOPS count	 

Standard / Magnetic : Lowest cost and lowest performance volumes.. 
	Min: 1 GB, Max: 1 TB..   IOPS : n/a

_________________________

use: gp2 and Magnetic.. These 2 comes under Free tier eligibility. 
30 gb only.. 

connect to your ec2 instance.. in run.. diskmgmt.msc..
Windows: FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux: ect3, ext4, xfs, nfs

--> Add a brand new volume and make it available. 
--> Increase existing volume size. 

--> VOlumes works at AZ level. If your instance is in ap-south-1a, we need to create a volume in same AZ to associate with this instance. 


Snapshot: Backup copy of our EBS volumes.. 

From a Snapshot, We can create multiple Copies of volumes in Multiple AZs, but in same Region. 


_____________

Task : Launch an ec2 instance in ap-south-1a.. Add 1 gb volume and make it avialble.. Add 1 more gb size to this volume and make 2gb availble.

Task 2 : launch an ec2 instance in ap-south-1b...   Get a copy of 2gb volume from task 1 and make it available for task 2 instance. 

______________

DLM : Data Lifecycle Manager : 
--> VOlume Level
--> Instance Level

Task: Launch an ec2 instance with 1 gb additional volume, and configure to take a backup copy at 06:00 AM IST Daily. Retention period: 2 Days.. 


Images : 
Scenario : 100 x Ec2 instance.. Install IIS, Install with AV, MS Office, CUstom WP, Putty, pdf.. 

GoldenAMI : CUstomized AMI.. 

Launch 1 EC2 instance --> Connect and configure with required settings --> Image

Recommanded: Stop instance before creating an Image. (follow/skip)

Using this GAMI --> We can copy this to ANother Region..
We can share this with another AWS account user. Or We can even make it public. 


CIS STandard: At ent level.. all our OS/Instances should comply with CIS benchmarks.
