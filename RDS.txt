Free tier : db.t2.micro, Everymonth 750 Hours..

We don't get any public IP address for db instances. We'll get Endpoints.

35 Days is Max backup retention period.

Multi-AZ : 
--> THis feature is designed for DR (DIsaster Recovery) purpose.
--> Another copy of DB runs in another AZ.
--> We will get charged double if we enable Multi-AZ. 
--> Multi-AZ doesn't provide any Scalability. 

Read Replica : 
--> ANother copy of our database, We can perform only Read Operations.
--> Whatever modifications happens in Primary db, it replicates immediatlely to Replica copy.
--> We can run Replica in Another Region, if required.
--> THis is purely for Scaling purpose.
--> If primary copy goes down, Write operations will effect on our application.
--> We can choose diff configuration for read replica if required.

--> If we don;t want to continue the replication, We can Promote the read replica. it works same as individual rds instance.

RDS Backup : Snapshot..
If we enable automatic backup option on RDS insatnce, whenever we perform any major modifications it'll create a backup copy automatically.
--> Automatic Backups : Also refered as Systems Backups : AWS Created automatically.
	--> We cannot delete it.
	--> Change backup retention period.
	--> Max retion period is 35 Days. Default 7 Days.
	--> If we delete RDS Instance, THese SS deletes automatically.

--> Manual Backups :
	--> We need to create manually.
	--> We can delete these when required.
--> We can share to another users / Make it public / copy to another region.
